## Introduction

As organizations move to cloud environments, network security remains a critical foundation. While infrastructure has shifted from physical devices to virtual systems, the core principles of secure network design still apply.

## Why Network Security Still Matters

Cloud platforms introduce flexibility, scalability, and remote accessibility. However, they also expand the attack surface. Proper segmentation, controlled access, and continuous monitoring are essential to protect data and services.

Technologies such as VLAN segmentation, secure DHCP configuration, and DNS management play a vital role in both traditional and cloud networks.

## The Key Takeaway

Security in the cloud is not automatic — it must be designed, configured, and maintained. Mastering networking fundamentals is essential for building secure, scalable, and resilient cloud infrastructures.

Network security is not just a technical requirement; it is the backbone of modern digital transformation.
